    <h1>What is object Oriented Programing</h1>
    <p>
      its the very basic overview of the object oriented programing in jva
      script . this paradym is developed <br />
      to organise the code it is depending on the objects . before the oop the
      code management is very difficult <br />
      becuase there are many function in the large code systems . the OOP is
      working with classes and objects clases are <br />
      the blue prints of the actual programe . the actual classes are not used
      in the java script . this is how we write a good <br />
      class this is depend on the 4 basic principal of the classes these 4 basic
      principals are describr below
    </p>
    <li><h2>The 4 basic pilars or OPP and classes</h2></li>
    <ol>
      <li>Abstraction</li>
      <li>Encapsulation</li>
      <li>Inheritance</li>
      <li>PolyMorphism</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Abstraction</h1>
    <p>
      Abstraction is about to hide the details of code that dont metter . like
      aphone we could not see the <br />
      inner functionality of the phone we only see the main purposes .
    </p>
    <h1>Encapsulation in OOP java script</h1>
    <p>The Encapsulation means keep private some properties of the class .</p>
    <h1>Inheritance in OOP IN JAVA SCRIPT</h1>
    <p>
      THE Inheritance in java script is the inherite the others classes in this
      class like a children <br />
      is inherite some functionalities from the parents . like we use the login
      functionality of the other <br />classes in our class
    </p>
    <h1>Polimorphism in OOP</h1>
    <p>
      Pholimorphism is the latin word which means many shapes . for Example we
      use the login methods <br />
      in the admin and its inherited by the user methods then we want to more
      secure way as login in as a<br />admin so we overrite this functionality
      and write the login methods in admin class and use this methods
