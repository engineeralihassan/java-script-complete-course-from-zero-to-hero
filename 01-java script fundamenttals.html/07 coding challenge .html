      Coding Challenge #1 Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body
      Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height **
      2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter). Your tasks:
      1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables 2. Calculate both
      their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions) 3.
      Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
      whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. Test data: ยง Data 1: Marks
      weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall. ยง
      Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is
      1.76 m tall. GOOD LUCK /p>
      <script>
        let markMass = 78;
        let markHeight = 1.69;
        let johnMass = 92;
        let johnHeight = 1.95;
        MarkBMI = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
        johnBMI = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2;
        let MarkHigherBMI;
        if (MarkBMI > johnBMI) {
          MarkHigherBMI = "The Mark has higher BMi the Joghn";
          console.log(MarkHigherBMI);
        }
